# Google Maps / Google My Business Scraper ðŸŒŽðŸ“Š

This is script is a scraping script developed with Python and its automation library Selenium. **Consists of reading a list of keywords, searching them in the Google Maps search, and getting its data and cover image**.

The script goes one by one searching for the keyword, and storing the data in a list, to finally export it to an Excel file located in the folder specified by the user when running the script.

In the presentation video I show the script running without hiding the Chrome window, and it can be seen quite clear the process that the script follows.

However, although I have added [that version](build/maps_scraper_juaristech_windowed_demo.exe) in the build folder, the final version and the one it is in the source code, works without showing the Chrome window, because it works with 5 simultaneous threads to increase the speed and obtain the results faster.

For now the script works only for Spanish and English languages, however, I can add more languages in the future.
